Have you ever had a difficulty pronouncing these words?

- sheep, ship, sheet
- beach
- very, berry
- island

What about these ones?

- ronronear
- hermano

# L2 Learning Scenarios
According to the *Second Language Linguistic Perception* (L2LP) model (van Leussen & Escudero, 2015)...
- Adult L2 learners rely on L1 categories when learning to perceive and produce L2 sounds.
- L2 *fully copies* the L1 perception system completely AND adjusts it to the new language.
- Gradual learning algorithm.
- 3 learning scenarios: similar (easy), new (hard), or subset (hard).

In conclusion: we have two different perception systems for our languages.
---
# The Problem
## What happens with our perception systems when we are bilinguals, and we learn a new L3?
---
# L3 learning scenarios: assumptions this study does
- Phoneme distributions from all three languages occupy a differentiated perceptual space (apply the L2LP model van Leussen & Escudero, 2015)).
- "L3 phonological acquisition differs from SLA due to much more complicated sources of language interactions, as either the L1, L2 or both can influence L3 phonology" (Wang & Nance, 2023).

# L3 acquisition
## Is there transfer of L1 and L2 into the L3? What language do they "prefer"?

# L3 acquisition
## What factors are more inflluential?
- *Language order of acquisition*: Multilinguals assimilate some L3 sounds to both L1 and L2 categories, with a preference for the latter (Wrembel et al, 2019). GE, EN, PO
- *Language proximity*: acquisition of L3 phonology is driven by the closest language known by the speaker (Cenoz, 2010) SP, VA, EN
- *Others*: languages status, proficiency.

# Research Question

**RQ1**: What weights more in L3 sounds acquisition: language order or language similarity?

**H1**: Bilinguals learning a new L3 associate it to the most similar language, regardless of the acquisition order of the L1 and L2.

# Participants
- **N** = 15
- **Mean age**: 21.7 years
- **Advanced late bilinguals**: L1 English, L2 Spanish, L3 Korean
- **L2 AoA** ~ 19 years
- **L2 CoA**: foreign language setting
- Lived in an L2-speaking country for +2 years
- Received course credit after participation

# Methods. Materials
## Screening Tests
- Language and Social Background Questionnaire (LSBQ, Anderson et al., 2018) in English
- LexTALE-Spanish and LexTALE-Korean (Lemhöfer & Broersma, 2012).

*Doubt*: L3 required level?
- According to Wrembel et al. (2019): "beginner L3 learners seem more likely to perceive subtle acoustic differences in novel phonological contrasts".
- But also according to Wang & Nance, (2023): "the lower the level of L3 proficiency, the greater the CLI from L2 to L3".

# Methods. Materials
## Discrimination Task
- *Focus*: perception.
- Listen to pseudo-artificial monosyllable KO words containing /ʌ/.
- Decide if it is an EN or SP sound.

*What they will be told?* "You will listen to Korean monosyllables. After hearing them, decide if they sound more English-like or Spanish-like."

- 80 trials (50 real sounds, 50 altered sounds (distractors)?).

---
# Methods. Materials
## Reading Aloud Task
- *Focus*: production.
- Read monosyllable KO words containing /ʌ/.

*What they will be told?* "You will see a sentence in Korean in the screen. "

- 30 trials (no distractors).
- Target words embeded into sentences.

# Methods. Procedure
- Welcome to the lab, signing consent
- LSBQ ~ 10 minutes
- LexTALE-Spanish ~ 5 minutes
- LexTALE-Korean ~ 8 minutes
- (short break)
- Discrimination Task ~ 20 minutes
- Reading Aloud Task ~ 20 minutes
- Debrief of the purpose of the study

# But... why?
1. Think: do you know any multilingual? Simultaneous? In 2022, one-quarter (24.7%) of working-age adults (defined here as people aged 25-64 years) in the EU reported that they knew 2 foreign languages, and 12.3% knew 3 or more (Eurostat, 2024).
3. Lack of theoretical background.
4. Great applicability in language teaching and education.
5. Most L3 research includes only Indo-European languages (Wang & Nance, 2023).
